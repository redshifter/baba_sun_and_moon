# Sun and Moon 
A Baba is You level pack containing around 40 levels, as well as an overarching puzzle of a world map.

There are a variety of levels, with many of them are based around the concepts of keeping yourself in the sunlight and keeping yourself out of the moonlight. Of course, it eventually devolves into random crap.

# How to install:
- Click the Code button and click "Download ZIP".
- Extract it to your Baba is You Data\Worlds folder. The result should look something like:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Baba Is You\Data\Worlds`
